# geo-features

`geo-features` is a [MojoðŸ”¥](https://github.com/modularml/mojo) package for
geographic or geometric vector features, for example: location data or earth
observation data. It is based upon the
[GeoJSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946) and [ISO/OGC Simple
Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) standards.

## requirements

- [Mojo](https://github.com/modularml/mojo) >= 0.4.0
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.9
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) >= 1.6

## project goals

- Apply Mojo's systems programming features to create a new geo package with strong
type safety and high performance.
- Promote [cloud native geospatial](https://cloudnativegeo.org/) computing and
open geospatial standards, ex: [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/).
- Leverage the vast Python ecosystem, wherever possible, to enable rapid
development and interoperability.
